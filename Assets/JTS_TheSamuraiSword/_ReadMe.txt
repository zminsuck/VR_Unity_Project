INSTALLATION
-------------
I. IMPORT FILES INTO YOUR PROJCT
Go to: “Assets -> Import Package -> Custom Package...” in the Unity Menu and select the “JTS_TheJapaneseSword_ver1.x.unitypackage” file. This will open an import dialog box. Click the import button and all files will be imported into your project list under a folder called JTS_TheSamuraiSword.

II. ADD THE ART PREFAB TO YOUR SCENE
There are two category of Prefabs included with The Japanese Sword:

PREFABS:
These consist of the normal highres mesh and are located in the 'Prefabs' folder.  These sword prefabs are the highest Level of Detail and include physics and colliders.  These are located in the "Prefabs" folder.

PREFABS_LOD:
These adjust between two LOD levels that automatically switch based on how far away they are from the scene camera.  Both LOD levels are setup with physics and colliders.  These are located in the "Prefabs_LOD" folder.


III. SCRIPTABLE RENDER PIPELINE?
If you are using UniversalRP or HDRP in your Unity project, see the "_SRP" folder for SRP install instructions.


A NOTE ABOUT PHYSICS:
By default each sword prefab has a rigidbody that has been set to 'kinematic'.  This is for convenience sake as in many cases you will not want gravity to automatically effect each sword object.  When you are ready to enable physics to each item sumply uncheck the 'is kinematic' option on the sword's Rigidbody component.
